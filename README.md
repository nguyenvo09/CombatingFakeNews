# Recommending Fact-checking Articles to Combat Fake News
This is the repository for the paper "The Rise of Guardians: Fact-checking URL Recommendation to Combat Fake News" SIGIR 2018,
https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07516 

## Datasets
- Link to download our full dataset for the paper: You can analyze characteristics of guardians based on this dataset.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n2nZT2440BYy7PDwdSwLMpWHKrKRObF1/view

- Link to download splitted data `Splitted_data.rar`
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1riEsUNP3GHfn7XefuMkH50kW4W2dL0qW

- The splitted data has training, dev and testing interactions. In each part, there are 12,197 guardians with at least
one interaction for each guardian

## Analysis
- Temporal behavior of guardians

## How to run this code?
- Download the splitted data and extract it. The expected path is `/pytorch/Splitted_data/sigir18/*`
- Then, run the following command with default settings:
```
python Masters/master_gau.py
```
You could achive following performance:
```
